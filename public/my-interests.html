		<h2>My Interests</h2>
				<p>I've got what you could call a pretty wide range of interests. I'm into cycling and running to keep fit and have fun, okay, the fun bit only really applies to cycling, and specifically, offroad cycling!</p>
        <p>I'm also very interested in cars/motorsport and love to tinker and spend too many hours cleaning my car. I also got a motorbike last year and I'm really enjoying life on two wheels where I don't get all puffed out!</p>
        <p>And then there's Scouting. Scouting has nearly always played a part in my life and I honestly think its the best thing I've ever done. Once I turned 18 I joined the adult section of Scouts in my local area (we call ourselves "Roosters") and since then I've met a bunch of like minded people of varying age, nearly every Thursday to do some sort of activity, followed by a visit to a local pub. There's actually so much I can say about what I've done in Scouting that I couldn't possibly document it all here, so feel free to ask me!</p>
