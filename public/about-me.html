  		<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I was born in '91 and I'm the eldest sibling, my brother is 2 years younger, but we are both the eldest cousins out of 15, soon to be 16, a large family I'm sure you'll agree. I had a pretty normal childhood I think.. I was always changing my mind about what I wanted to do so ended up with a bunch of different qualifications dependant on what it was I had wanted to do at the time. I've worked since I was able to, working for the likes of McDonalds, Beefeater, Tog24 and Sainsburys.</p>
      <p>I currently work for a great company, Holiday Extras, based in Newingreen, just off J11 of the M20. They are a business that sells airport parking, hotels and lounges, as well as travel insurance and many other extras you might need for your holiday. There is a second office nearby that houses the Short Breaks side of the business, they deal in theme park tickets and hotels as well as theatre shows and hotels. There is a third office that focuses on the european market, so naturally, they are based in Munich, which I have had the pleasure of visiting since I started with the company. There's loads more that I could tell you about them, but I'd probably just be re-writing content from their site, so I might as well shamelessly plug it.. www.holidayextras.co.uk - this is one of the websites we work on and maintain in the web team, which is what I do, specifically I'm a software tester.</p>
